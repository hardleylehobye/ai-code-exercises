# Exercise: Code Readability Challenge (JavaScript)

This exercise focuses on using AI to improve **code readability** (naming, structure, clarity) in **JavaScript** without changing behavior.

## Link to JavaScript examples in this repo

- **refactor-exercise/exercise3-javascript/** — Code duplication: `calculateUserStatistics` refactored with `statsForField`; clear names and one helper per concern.
- **function-decomposition-challenge/1-javascript-validation/** — Validation broken into named helpers (`validateUsername`, `validateEmail`, etc.); main function reads as a pipeline.

Use these as references for the “Understanding What to Change” and Code Readability exercises.

## Code Readability Challenge checklist

1. **Pick a JavaScript function or file** with unclear names, deep nesting, or unclear intent.
2. **Use an AI “readability” prompt**, e.g.  
   *“Improve readability of this JavaScript code using standard naming conventions. Do not change behavior. Focus on variable names, function names, and structure.”*
3. **Compare** the AI’s suggestions with your own; note what you’d keep or change.
4. **Document** what you improved and one thing you’d do differently next time.
5. **If the code has tests**, run them before and after to confirm behavior is preserved.

## Next: Assessment

After completing the refactor exercises (Understanding What to Change, Function Decomposition, Design Pattern Implementation, and Code Readability), complete **Assessment: Using AI to refactor and enhance code** on the LMS when available.
