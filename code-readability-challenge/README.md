# Exercise: Code Readability Challenge

This exercise focuses on using AI to improve **code readability** (naming, structure, clarity) without changing behavior.

## Link to existing materials

The **refactor-exercise** folder already contains a full **Code Readability** example (Exercise 1 – Java):

- **refactor-exercise/exercise1-java/** — `UserMgr` / `U` refactored to `UserManager` / `User` with clear names, extracted validation, and notes on SQL injection.
- **refactor-exercise/REFLECTION.md** — Reflection questions and learnings.

Use that as your reference for the “Understanding What to Change with AI” and Code Readability exercises.

## Code Readability Challenge checklist

1. **Pick a piece of code** with unclear names, deep nesting, or unclear intent.
2. **Use an AI “readability” prompt**, e.g.  
   *“Improve readability of this code using standard [language] naming conventions. Do not change behavior. Focus on variable names, method/function names, and structure.”*
3. **Compare** the AI’s suggestions with your own; note what you’d keep or change.
4. **Document** what you improved and one thing you’d do differently next time.
5. **If the code has tests**, run them before and after to confirm behavior is preserved.

## Next: Assessment

After completing the refactor exercises (Understanding What to Change, Function Decomposition, Design Pattern Implementation, and Code Readability), use **Assessment: Using AI to refactor and enhance code** to check your understanding and submit as required by the course.
